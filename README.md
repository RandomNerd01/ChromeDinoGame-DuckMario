# Dino Game (But With Duck Sprite and Mario Items)
Similarly to the Normal Dino Game, you will Die when you hit an Obstacle however there is now a lives counter on top left of page to show you how many lives you have. A remix of the Mario Death Sound will also be Played.

## Mario Star
If you run through the Star, You won't die for 4 seconds and a remix of the Mario Star Theme will play during this duration, allowing you to run through all obstacles with no issue. After the 4 seconds and when the music stops playing, you will be able to die again.

The Star can be Refreshed so if u run through a star while another star is in effect, it will simply reset the star duration back to  4 seconds

## Mario Mushroom
Similarly to the normal mario red mushroom, it gives you an extra life in which you won't die if u hit thenext obstacle. However the next obstacle will decrease your life back to one(However, like mario red mushrooms, this effect only works for just one obstacle- aka the next obstacle you hit).

Similar to Mario Red Mushrooms, you can only have 1 mushroom in effect so max number of lives is 2. Once you have consumed a mushroom, you cannot consume another one until you lose the effect of the first mushroom
