Similarly to the Normal Dino Game, you will Die when you hit an Obstacle however there is now a lives counter on top left of page to show you how many lives you have.

## Mario Star
If you run through the Star, You won't die for 4 seconds and a remix of the Mario Star Theme will play during this duration, allowing you to run through all obstacles with no issue.




## Mario Mushroom
Similarly to the normal mario red mushroom, it gives you an extra life in which you won't die (However, like mario red mushrooms, this effect only works for just one obstacle).
